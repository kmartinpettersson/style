<header>Vidhance Stabilization Details</header>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document gives some additional details on the Vidhance real-time image stabilization, and its access from Vidview
</p>

<h2>Vidhance Stabilization</h2>
<p>The Vidhance video stabilization is designed to reduce unwanted motion in the video, typically as a result of a moving camera platform.
The goal is to adapt the video to enhance the performance of a human observer; to reduce shakiness vision fatigue as well as supporting human perception.
The Vidhance video stabilization function relies fully on real-time video analysis, and is thus a full real-time, sensor- and telemetry independent function. 
The function uses analysis metadata from the Vidhance motion analysis engine. To allow for real-time, minumum-latency performance, analysis is made on current and previous
video data, where motion is identified. 
</p>

<p>The Vidhance stabilizer is highly optimized, and are able to identify planar motion, rotational motion, as well as z-axis (optical axis) motion.
This motion information is then used to correct the displayed video. The Vidhance stabilizer has been trained and adapted using a large data set of authentic video,
from aerial, land, marine and submarine platforms. The method of efficiently finding, selecting and re-evaluate tie-points, and the correction transformation methods,
have been filed as patent application in both the U.S. and European Union. 
</p>
 
<h2>Performance and examples</h2>
 <p>The Vidhance video stabilization completes the full motion analysis and transformation procedure with less than one video frame delay, for standard PAL or NTSC video.
 The stabilization typically yield in the order of four to eight times reduction in unwanted motion. Vidhance stabilization works independantly on any pre-stabilization
 applied, for example through the use of gyro gimbal camera mounts, or electronic hardware stabilization. Some vibration frequencis will be difficult for a gimbaled
 system to reduce, and when using high levels of zoom, even small vibrations will be multiplied and hence reduce visibility. Vidhance resolves also these situations.
 Vidhance video stabilization also use and store all available video data, whereas an electronic hardware stabilizer, with a fixed output frame size, will black
 out cornes, and the larger the vibration amplitude, the more data will get lost.
  </p>

 <p>The below image shows a frequency diagram, with data from video captured from a small UAS. The red line is the motion amplitude of the original video,
 and the green line is after Vidhance stabilization. Note that Vidhance applies a cutoff frequency for dampening for low frequencies, as this relates to
 operator-intended motion, such as camera panning.

 <p>The graph below shows another way of presenting the Vidhance stabilization performance. It is a pixel-walk diagram, where an individual pixel
 is followed over a number of frames. Here, the blue lines represent the pixel motion in the original video, and the red the motion pattern for the same pixel
 after Vidhance stabilization. The result for a human observer is a smoother viewing experience.

  <p>The following graph shows the effect of rotational stabilization, as angular rotational motion over a series of 150 video frames. The blue line represent
  the original video, and the red line after Vidhance stabilization.

  <h2>Modes and adaptability in Vidview</h2>
 <p>Video stabilization also relates to presenting video on a viewing window on a screen. The correction transformation of the Vidhance stabilization thus also
 incorporates parameters and decision criterias for display, to handle situations where the video frame is moving close to the borders of the viewing window.
  </p>
  
  <p>When accessed from Imint Vidview, the Vidhance stabilizer can be used in four pre-configured modes.
  <ol>
	<li>Overview mode; when the full video is being observed by a passive user (lacking control of the camera)</li>
	<li>Zoom mode; when a passive user (lacking control of the camera) observes a zoomed-in part of the video.</li>
	<li>Operator mode; when the video is being observed by an operator with camera control.</li>
	<li>Automatic mode; adaptive parameter selection based on meta-analysis.</li>
  </p>
